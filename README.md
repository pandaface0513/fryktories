# fryktories
A repo for an upcoming interactive tale of beacon and torch
* Here we will store the engine (source code), json files required for the story, as well as images and audio (if we get there)
* perhaps we will host the first chapter using gh-pages branch as well...pending decision
* for dev purposes, we can request the json files directly
* but we shouldn't do that in future
* maybe we can make this a browser extension

# Story
* story details come later
* to be continued

# Tech
* Let's do React :)
* there's something called react-fiction I could use

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
