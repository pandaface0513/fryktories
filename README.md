# fryktories
A repo for an upcoming interactive tale of beacon and torch
* Here we will store the engine (source code), json files required for the story, as well as images and audio (if we get there)
* perhaps we will host the first chapter using gh-pages branch as well...pending decision
* for dev purposes, we can request the json files directly
* but we shouldn't do that in future
* maybe we can make this a browser extension

# Story
* story details come later
* to be continued

# Tech
* Let's do React :)
* there's something called react-fiction I could use
